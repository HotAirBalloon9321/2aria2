## 👋 Hey there! I'm Aria

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate coder who loves the beach, surfing, and, of course, cinnamon rolls. 🍩🏄‍♀️

🌟 About Me
- 🏖️ If I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me by the ocean.
- 🏄‍♀️ Surfing is my escape—just like debugging, but with waves instead of errors!
- 🍥 Cinnamon rolls fuel my late-night coding sessions.
- 😈 Chaotic Evil!

💻 What I Do
- 🌱 Currently learning golang.
- 🔨 Working on random stuff I guess.
- 🤝 Open to collaborations on cool projects, open-source contributions, and hackathons.
- 🌐 Persuing a Diploma in Cybersecurity!
